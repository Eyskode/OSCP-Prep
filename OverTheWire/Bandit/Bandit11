The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

Command: cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
This one is a bit confusing but with tr we're just saying to replace all the letters to the letter +13 positions in the alphabet with the command tr wich means transform
