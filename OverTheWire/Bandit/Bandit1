The flag from the previous Level is the password for the user Bandit1 se we just need to connect.
After using our ls we'll se a file called "-"
we can't use the comand: cat - because it will wait for an option Like cat -A , -b , -e et.
A way to evade this is just aplying cat to the full route
cat /home/bandit1/-
cat ./-
The ./ means "On this directory"
So we get the flag
