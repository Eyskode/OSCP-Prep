First of all we need all numbers betwen 0000-9999 then we have to send them through netcat with the flag
So i created a script for that
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0000..9999}; do
     echo "flag from las lelvel $i"
done
Then we get the dictionary
./script.sh > dictionary.txt
When its done we just need to send it through netcat on the 30002 port
cat dictionary.txt | nc localhost 30002
and it will give us the flag
