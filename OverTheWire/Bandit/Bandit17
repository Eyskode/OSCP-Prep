There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new
We just have to use the command diff
Command: diff passwords.new passwords.old and it will give us 2 possible flags
