The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

First of all we just need to check all the ports that we have open so we'll use Nmap
Command: nmap --open -p31000-32000 127.0.0.1
So now we can see that only 5 ports are open, lets try to connect them just like in the last Level
The port 31790 will give us id_rsa
