For this Level we just need to log in through SSH to the OverTheWire lab on the Port 2220
The User and Password is given bandit0:bandit0
So the command must be:
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -P 2220
After using our password we can see a File called "readme" 
we just need to cat this file an we'll get the flag:
cat readme
