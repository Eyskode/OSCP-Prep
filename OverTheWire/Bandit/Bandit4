In this Level we have to find the unique Human-Readable file in the "inhere" directory.
So we can just use the file comand so we can see the file format
command: file ./*
the * means that will do the command file for all the files in the directory
we can see that the "-file07" is ASCII Text so we just cat ./-file07 and we'll get the flag
