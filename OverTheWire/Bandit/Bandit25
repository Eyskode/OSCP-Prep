For this Level we can use the vim
We should make our console very small so we enter into the "more" view, now we can open vim pressing v
after that we just need to :e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
so if we want to log in as bandit26 we just need to do the same process but spawning a shell
:set shell=/bin/bash
now executing this varible "shell" we'll get access
