The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost
So we will send the password of the bandit14 user through netcat
echo "flag of bandit14" | nc 127.0.0.1 30000
we can also connect through telnet and send de flag so we get flag for the next level
telnet 127.0.0.1 30000
