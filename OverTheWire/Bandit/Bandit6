In this Level we have to find the flag which is stored into a file owned by user bandit7 owned by group bandit6 and 33 bytes in size SOMEWHERE IN THE SERVER

First of all we must go to /
then we can find the file with the next command:
find -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6
It will give us all the files with these features, we dont have permission in most of them.
So we can add to the command find -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null 
2>/dev/null means send to /dev/null all those files thats give us the "2" error message that is "permission denied"
find -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null | xargs cat 
This last command will give us the flag
