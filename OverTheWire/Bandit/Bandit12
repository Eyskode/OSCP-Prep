The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

For this Level you have first of all to reverse the hexdump with the next command: cat data.txt | xxd -r > data
Now we can use the file command for data
file data
It will say that is compressed in GZ then we have to change the name to data.gz after decompressing we'll see that is a file called data2, then we have to see the file type
Is a BZ compression, we have to decompress...Till we get the flag
