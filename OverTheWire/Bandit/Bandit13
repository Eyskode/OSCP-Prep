The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

So when we list the files in our home directory we'll see a private SSH Key
So we just try to connect to the bandit14 user using this key
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
Once we are connected we can just cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
